##What is SQL Injection?
It's a vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.

##Types of SQLi:

In-band (Classic): Error-based or union-based.

Blind: Boolean or time-based.

Out-of-band: Using different channels for data exfiltration.

##Demonstrate a basic SQLi attack:

Input something like ' OR '1'='1 -- into a login form.

##Mitigation Techniques

Prepared Statements:
Use parameterized queries to ensure that user input is treated as data, not code.

Input Validation:
Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent malicious data.

Web Application Firewall (WAF):
Use a WAF to filter out malicious queries.
