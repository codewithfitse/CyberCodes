# 🛡️ Cyber Security Roadmap — 6 Month Plan

This repository documents a **6‑month ethical hacking / cyber security learning path**.
The roadmap is **modular**: if a topic is already well understood and can be explained and applied, it can be skipped without breaking the flow.

The goal is strong fundamentals, practical skills, and real‑world security thinking — not shortcuts.

---

## 📅 Month 1 — Foundations

### Linux Fundamentals

Learn how Linux systems work at a practical level. Focus on the file system structure, permissions, users and groups, process management, package management, and daily terminal usage. Linux should feel natural, not intimidating.

### Networking Basics

Understand how computers communicate. Study TCP and UDP, IP addresses and ports, DNS resolution, HTTP and HTTPS, and basic firewall concepts. Practice scanning systems and observing network traffic.

### Git & Internet Basics

Learn version control using Git and understand how websites function from browser to server. Read open‑source code to build the habit of analyzing real projects.

### Security Fundamentals

Cover core security concepts such as the CIA Triad, threats vs vulnerabilities, authentication vs authorization, and hashing vs encryption. Review the OWASP Top 10 to understand common risk categories.

---

## 📅 Month 2 — Programming for Hackers

### Python for Security

Use Python as a security automation tool. Practice HTTP requests, socket programming, regular expressions, file handling, and writing small utilities like scanners or automation scripts.

### JavaScript for Web Attacks

Understand how JavaScript behaves in the browser. Study the DOM, cookies, sessions, local storage, and client‑side validation weaknesses.

### Bash & SQL

Learn Bash scripting for automation and chaining tools. Study SQL fundamentals and understand how SQL injection vulnerabilities occur and are exploited.

---

## 📅 Month 3 — Web Hacking

Focus on common and high‑impact web vulnerabilities. Study SQL injection, XSS (reflected, stored, and DOM‑based), CSRF, IDOR, authentication flaws, session handling issues, and insecure file uploads. Practice using tools such as Burp Suite and intentionally vulnerable applications.

Learn basic bug bounty methodology, including reconnaissance, scope reading, and writing clear vulnerability reports.

---

## 📅 Month 4 — System & Network Hacking

### Linux Privilege Escalation

Learn how misconfigurations lead to higher privileges. Study SUID binaries, sudo misconfigurations, cron jobs, PATH abuse, and enumeration techniques.

### Windows Fundamentals

Understand Windows internals relevant to security: users, groups, services, registry, and common misconfigurations.

### Exploitation Tools

Learn how exploitation frameworks work, including payloads, reverse shells, and post‑exploitation techniques. Tools should be understood, not blindly relied upon.

---

## 📅 Month 5 — Practice Phase

Dedicate this month entirely to hands‑on practice. Solve labs and machines on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box. Focus on enumeration, persistence, and learning from mistakes. Take structured notes and repeat challenges without walkthroughs when possible.

---

## 📅 Month 6 — Specialization & Career Prep

Choose one specialization path:

* Web Security / Bug Bounty
* Penetration Testing
* Blue Team / SOC
* Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering

Build a small portfolio by completing full machines, writing technical write‑ups, and organizing notes. Optional entry‑level certifications can be pursued if helpful.

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

Strong fundamentals matter more than tools.
Depth beats speed.
Practice turns knowledge into skill.
Always stay legal and ethical.

Consistency over time is the real advantage.
